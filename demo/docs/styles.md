# Styles

## Global Styles

The entry point for global styles is the `src/index.scss` file. This file should not contain any code except for import statements importing modularised global styles from the `src/styles/global` folder. Anything imported by this file, or it's imported files will be extracted into a separate CSS file so that it may be loaded in parallel with the project's JavaScript. 

## Styling Helpers

Styling helpers modules are placed within the `src/styles/helpers` folder. Any files in this folder will start with an underscore, since they won't be compiled directly by SASS.

## Browser Prefixes

Browser prefixes are auto generated by AutoPrefixer, so they do not need to be included while writing code. The `browserslist` file contains all the browsers which prefixes will be generated for.
